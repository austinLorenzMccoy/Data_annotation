# Humor Classification Project

This project is designed to classify humor in text data. It provides scripts and configuration for preparing data, training models, and evaluating results.

## Project Structure
- `config/` – Configuration files for model and data processing
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets
- `scripts/` – Scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation
- `output/` – Model outputs and results

## Getting Started
1. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate humor_classification
   ```
2. Prepare your data and adjust configuration files as needed.
3. Run scripts in the `scripts/` directory to train and evaluate models.

## Purpose
The aim is to build and evaluate models that can detect and classify humor in various text sources.
