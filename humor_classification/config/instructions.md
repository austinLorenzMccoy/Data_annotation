# Humor Classification Guidelines

## Labels
- üòÑ **Funny**: Content that is genuinely humorous and entertaining
- üòê **Not Funny**: Content that attempts humor but fails or is neutral
- üòà **Dark Humor**: Humor involving morbid or serious topics
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Offensive**: Content that crosses ethical boundaries or is inappropriate

## Guidelines
1. Read the entire text before classifying
2. Consider cultural context
3. If multiple categories apply, choose the most prominent one
4. Mark potentially harmful content as Offensive

### Key Features:
- Single-label classification
- Four distinct humor categories
- Real-time annotation interface
- Quality control mechanisms
- Export capabilities for machine learning

### Target Outcomes:
- Create a high-quality labeled dataset for humor classification
